## Standard Query Operators

### Desciption

We can use a LINQ operator on both `query syntax` and `method syntax`.
LINQ Operators are simple extension methods that provide different functionalities such as `sorting` and `filtering`. We can use them on both `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable` types.
An Operator in query syntax will be converted to extension method at compile time.

There are over `50 standard query operators` that are defined in two classes:
- System.Linq.Enumerable
- System.Linq.Queryable
